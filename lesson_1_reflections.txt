How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped us because we could see the difference between those 2 files and check why the app isnt running correctly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You could be more efficient in this way because you can see your mistakes while you'r comparing between one file and other

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Because its Up to you choose the changes which real impact in your app and sometimes you can write about a commit which is not real relevant
If you do commit manually you can write with your own words what changes you do and in a future you can understan easier

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allows saving multiple files in one commit, while others , like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think is because not to use amount of storage memory

how can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
using the command git log shows me the commits's list to see all commits that I have done and using the command git diff I can select to commits by its IDs numbers and see the diffrents between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because if I can revert all the changes that I made I can change everythin and return to a point in which all was working well

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I hope try it soon , when I Will creating an Android Product
